# Binary Parsing
Welcome to the activity for binary parsing!

In the `data/` directory you will find 3 binary files and a Kaitai Struct YML definition for the header of a PNG file. For each binary file (including the PNG):  

1. Print out the contents of the file in hex
2. Print out the size of the file
3. Follow the instructions in the corresponding TXT file

Once that has been done for each file, you can get a sticker. If you would like to try the header for another file for another sticker, you can find some simple YML definitions at the [Kaitai Struct Format Gallery](https://formats.kaitai.io/).

To get started, clone this repository (if you have Gitpod that's easiest) and begin working.
